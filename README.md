# ldmx-sw at UMN

This repository is focused on helping LDMX collaborators use ldmx-sw at UMN.

As of March 17, 2021, `singularity` has been installed on all zebra and scorpion machines.
This means we can effectively archive our bare metal build here and use the standard container-based build.

Look at the [bare metal build](bare_metal_build.md) notes for how the dependencies outside of the container were set up.

## Quick Start

With singularity installed, we can follow the regular quick start instructions on the [ldmx-sw/README](https://github.com/LDMX-Software/ldmx-sw#quick-start) starting at step three.

For a more detailed explanation, look at the [Getting Started Guide](getting_started.md).
